Refactoring:
Techniques that allow for more abstraction:
    Encapsulate Field: Make a field private and give access to it with getter
    and setter methods.
    Generalize Type: Create more general types to allow for more code sharing.
Techniques for breaking code apart into more logical pieces:
    Extract Method: Turn part of a larger method into a new method to make it
    easier to understand.
    Extract Class: Move part of the code from an existing class into a new class.
Techniques for improving names and the location of code:
    Move Method or Move Field: Move to a more appropriate class or source file.
    Rename Method or Rename Field: Change the name to better reveal its purpose.
    Pull Up: In object-oriented programming, move to a base class.
    Push Down: In object-oriented programming, move to a derived class.

Decomposition by Design
If you are modular decomposition and approach every module, method, or function by considering what
pieces of it you can put off until later, your programs will generally be less dense and more organized
than if you implemented every feature in its entirety as you coded.

Capitalization
Variables and data members almost always start with a lowercase letter and either use underscores (my_queue)
or capitals (myQueue) to indicate word breaks.
lowercase functions and methods to distinguish them from class names.

The Curly Brace Alignment Debate
the curly brace is put on the same line as the leading statement, except in the case of a function, class, or
method name

Coming to Blows over Spaces and Parentheses
a space before and after any operator, a space after every comma in a parameter list or a call, and parentheses to
clarify the order of operations
a space before the content, a space after the content
