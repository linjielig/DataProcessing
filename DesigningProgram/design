1. The gross subdivision of the program into subsystems, including interfaces and dependencies between the subsystems, data
flow between the subsystems, input and output to and from each subsystem, and general threading model.
2. The details of each subsystem, including subdivision into classes, class hierarchies, data structures, algorithms, specific
threading model, and error-handling specifics.

Requirements
Divide the Program into Subsystems
Choose Threading Models
Specify Class Hierarchies for Each Subsystem
Specify Classes, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Patterns for Each Subsystem
Specify Error Handling for Each Subsystem


A good object-oriented hierarchy accomplishes the following:
    Organizes classes into meaningful functional relationships
    Supports code reuse by factoring common functionality to base classes
    Avoids having derived classes that override much of the parent's functionality, unless the parent is an abstract class.
