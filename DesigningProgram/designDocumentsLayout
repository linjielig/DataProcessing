1. The gross subdivision of the program into subsystems, including interfaces and dependencies between the subsystems, data
flow between the subsystems, input and output to and from each subsystem, and general threading model.
2. The details of each subsystem, including subdivision into classes, class hierarchies, data structures, algorithms, specific
threading model, and error-handling specifics.
